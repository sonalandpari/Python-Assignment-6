# Python-Assignment-6
Submission for Python Assignment-6

This zipped Folder contains the Task for Assignment 6: A basic calculator.

However, this project isn't perfect or completely polished
- It doesn't display "Error" on the Entry screen for ZeroDivisionError(I already tried many ways, I am out of ideas for now)
- And I couldn't make the "CE" Button work completely, it only deletes the first input number
